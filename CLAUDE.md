# ui

A public shadcn registry (`registry.json` at the root, items under `registry/base-nova/`, `shadcn build` → `public/r/*.json`) plus the Next demo site that serves it and is the lab for every primitive. Namespace `@ag`. Consumers copy items and own the copy; this repo is the source. The shape is shadcn's own `registry-template-v4`, on Base UI + Tailwind 4 + `base-nova`.

## Rules

- Every item has a `<name>.demo.tsx` beside its source and an entry in `app/demos.tsx`; `scripts/validate-registry.ts` refuses anything else. `lib/*` files are framework-free (no react, no DOM), asserted.
- Imports inside items use `@/registry/base-nova/{ui,lib,hooks,blocks}/...`; the CLI rewrites them to the consumer's aliases. A `.css` beside a component is imported relatively (`./x.css`) and ships as a second `registry:ui` file.
- Motion is CSS-first: scroll-driven animations (`animation-timeline`) drive numbers into custom properties; React state changes on checkpoints, never per frame. Reduced motion renders the completed state.
- Brand rules from `untitled/CLAUDE.md` bind: lowercase names, three type voices, 8px doubling rhythm, monochrome alpha ladder, no em dashes, nothing animates forever.
- No Radix. Base UI has no `asChild`; use `render={<a />}`.

## Distribution

The site deploys on every push to main (Vercel project `ui`, team adriangalileas-projects, git-connected, deployment protection OFF so the registry is public) at `https://ui.adriangalilea.com` (DNS-only CNAME `ui` → cname.vercel-dns.com in the adriangalilea.com Cloudflare zone; `ui-adriangalileas-projects.vercel.app` is the same deployment), and consumers map `@ag` to `https://ui.adriangalilea.com/r/{name}.json`. `public/r/*.json` is COMMITTED as well (`shadcn build` runs inside `mise check` and inside the Vercel build), so `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriangalilea/ui/main/public/r/{name}.json` is the same registry before a deploy finishes. A stale build shows up as a diff. Vercel needs `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1` (set) to honour `packageManager` pnpm 11; without it the build ignores `allowBuilds` and `overrides`.

`registry:file` items (tokens) need an explicit `target`; the consumer imports `app/tokens.css` from its globals.css once.

## Lightbox

`ui/lightbox.tsx` is the binder; `lib/lightbox-motion.ts` (fit, source view, zoom, rubber, springs, flight sampling, `frameAt`) and `lib/lightbox-actions.ts` (the key table: keys, layers, `resolve`, the escape ladder, `sheet()`) are framework-free and proven by `scripts/examples/lightbox-motion.ts`. Every pose move is a Web Animation sampled from the spring (compositor properties only: transform, and the cover crop as two counter-scaled transforms); a gesture reads the animation's clock and takes over. React state changes on checkpoints.

- **WebKit hands `Animation.currentTime` back a hair under the duration** (seconds in, milliseconds out): a frame table indexed by time treats anything within `TIME_EPS` of the last frame as the last frame, or every flight on iOS fails to land and the frame loop dies. `frameAt` clamps its index and screams on a non-finite time.
- `debug` prop (demo: `?debug`) draws the engine's trace on the stage: pointer, gesture and dispatch decisions with the live pose, the layer's computed matrix, the live animation count, and page errors with a stack. This is how iOS bugs get diagnosed; production source maps are on for the same reason.
- iOS selects an image on a double tap unless the stage takes the default on pointerdown and the media carries `user-select: none` and no touch callout.
- Safari's Tab visits only fields: the dialog walks Tab over its own tabbables.
- History is replace-only (`#lb=id`); pushState made the iOS edge swipe double-animate a close. Android Back closes via CloseWatcher.
- The architecture debt and the extraction plan are in the todo below; do them before adopting the item in a site.

## Verbs

`mise dev` (:3100) · `mise check` · `mise build` · `mise add <item> [consumer-dir]` (builds, then `shadcn add` from the local `public/r`). package.json keeps `build` for Vercel only. Runnable examples live in `scripts/examples/` (`bun scripts/examples/session-still.ts`), never inside a lib file.

## Supply chain

pnpm's 7-day quarantine and no-downgrade trust policy apply. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` pins `fastq` to 1.20.1 because 1.20.2 shipped without provenance; drop the override once 1.20.3 clears quarantine (`deps overrides --removable`). The shadcn CLI version is whatever the quarantine admits, not `latest`. shadcn 4.19 wants the npm package `cn` (a name shadcn took over on 2026-09-01); under the quarantine that resolves to the 2013 Chuck Norris jokes CLI, so `lib/utils.ts` is the classic clsx + tailwind-merge `cn` and the package is not a dependency.

## todo

### lightbox: extract the engine (before any site adopts it)

`ui/lightbox.tsx` is ~3,000 lines whose heart is one `useLayoutEffect` holding some sixty closures over three mutable bags (engine `S`, gesture `G`, wheel `W`). It works, but nothing in it runs outside a browser and every fix lands as another closure. Extract framework-free modules in the shape of `lightbox-motion`, each with its case in `scripts/examples/`, behavior unchanged:

- `lib/lightbox-flight.ts`: the Web Animation flight, its clock, landing, the mid-flight takeover (pose + velocity off the table).
- `lib/lightbox-gesture.ts`: the pointer state machine as a pure reducer: events in, intents out (pan, slide, dismiss, pinch, tap, double tap), the axis locks and relocks, the release rules.
- `lib/lightbox-wheel.ts`: the trackpad session, the inertia guard, the release.
- `lib/lightbox-hold.ts`: the held-key loop (arrows pan, + and - zoom, axes add).
- `ui/lightbox.tsx` stays the binder: DOM listeners in, intents to the modules, React state at checkpoints only.

Also on the item: the demo streams a 17.8 MB trailer from blender.org on every open (host a short clip on the site); Safari frame pacing is unmeasured (needs Develop → Allow Remote Automation, then WebDriver); the sign-off list is `unverified` for Android.

### then: adopt, wave 2, wave 3

1. adriangalilea.com prose figures (retire its `components/lightbox.tsx`), the garden's feature stills, videoclub.
2. `scrollspy` (scroll-intent stand-down), `page-exit` / `page-enter` (the faked cross-origin morph: exit animation, Speculation Rules prerender with `Supports-Loading-Mode: credentialed-prerender` on the subdomain, entrance), `keymap` + `cursor-list` / `cursor-grid` (swift-utils Keymap; the lightbox's action table is the first client).
3. `charts` + `chart-frame` (adriangalilea.com's wrappers are the taste anchor), `particle-charts` as the opt-in playful voice, `narrated` (Sonoscript: real times only, click to seek, opt-in follow).
4. The garden landing (a static grid under a fog that promises content), then later: cover-image with blur and grain, `magic-input`, the media-library kit for videoclub and lore.

### og and link previews as a registry item

Every site re-solves the same thing by hand and it always eats an afternoon: the `opengraph-image` route, fonts loaded for satori, a card layout that survives the crop every platform applies (Twitter 2:1 vs iMessage vs Telegram vs Slack), the wordmark overlay, the fallback when a page has no cover, and checking the result in each unfurler.

Vehicle: the registry, not ts-utils. The generator is React-shaped (satori renders JSX through `ImageResponse`), so it cannot live in a runtime-agnostic utils package; a shadcn item can ship files at explicit targets (`registry:file` → `app/opengraph-image.tsx`, `lib/og.tsx`), which is exactly a template plus a layout library. ts-utils only ever gets the pure parts if any appear (text fitting, title truncation rules).

Shape to build: an `og` item with `lib/og.tsx` = card layouts as components for `ImageResponse` (cover card, quote card, wordmark-only card, terminal-still card), one font loader (Geist, Geist Mono, Courier Prime from the same next/font sources the site already uses), the safe-area rules per platform baked into the layouts, and the size constants; plus a `registry:file` template `app/opengraph-image.tsx` that reads a page's title, description and cover and picks the layout. A demo page renders every layout at 1200x630 with the crop overlays of each platform drawn on top, so a card is designed once against all of them. Seeds: adriangalilea.com `lib/og.tsx` (quote and cover cards with local Geist TTFs), the garden's `app/icon.tsx` (SPROUT_PATHS through `ImageResponse`) and its `app/dev/mock/cover` page (the xtldr phone trio framed for the link preview).
