# ui

Adrian Galilea's web components, as a [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry). One source; every site copies what it uses and owns the copy.

```jsonc
// components.json, in the consumer
{ "registries": { "@ag": "https://ui.adriangalilea.com/r/{name}.json" } }
```

```bash
npx shadcn add @ag/scroll-stage
```

Items live in `registry/base-nova/`, a demo beside each one, played at `/<item>` on the site (`mise dev`). `mise check` asserts the registry; `mise build` emits `public/r/*.json`.

| item | what |
|---|---|
| `tokens` | the studio's voice over shadcn's neutral theme: type voices, tones, the alpha ladder, motion |
| `scroll-stage` | the pinned stage: a tall track, a sticky stage, `--stage-p` from a CSS scroll-driven animation, acts as checkpoints |
| `reveal` | content that arrives as it enters the viewport |
| `scrims` | viewport fogs, scroll-linked, never transitioned |
| `terminal-session` | the terminal-session script: parse, palette, timeline, SVG still |
| `terminal` | a phosphor terminal playing a session live |
| `telegram-chat` | a Telegram chat on an iPhone as a pure function of `{messages, progress}` |
| `telegram-summary` | a link-summary bot's conversation on top of `telegram-chat` |
| `lightbox` | one interruptible spring over a view: the image leaves the page under its chrome, gestures, every key in a table, deep links; `lightbox-motion` (the math) and `lightbox-actions` (the key table) beneath it |
