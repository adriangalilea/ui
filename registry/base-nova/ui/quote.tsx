// Somebody else's words, on the page, at THREE WEIGHTS — and every one of them reads its
// numbers from `quote-card`, the same module that draws the social preview, so there is
// nothing to keep in sync by hand and nothing that can drift when either is touched.
//
//   card     the poster: the portrait bleeding out of the right edge, the ghost mark, the
//            words composed in the band. It IS the link preview, drawn in the DOM.
//   feature  the page's own weight: no frame, no portrait — the mark, the words set at
//            display size over it, one line of attribution. What a quote's own page opens
//            with, and the step the other two left missing.
//   prose    a quotation inside an article, at the page's own type, marked by a small
//            mark rather than a rule. What an embed in a feed card is.
//
// WHAT THE THREE CANNOT SHARE WITH THE STILL is measurement. A browser knows exactly how
// wide a character is and the still has no way to find out, so the still estimates `ch`
// and these state the measure in real `ch` and let the layout engine be right. They agree
// on how many characters a line carries; they may disagree about which word ends one.
//
// It renders a real `<blockquote>` with a real `<cite>`, because that is what this is,
// and a screen reader announcing "blockquote" is information the styling cannot carry.
//
// STYLE IS UTILITIES IN THE JSX, merged with `cn` and `className` last, the way every
// shadcn item is, so a consumer overrides a padding by passing a class and never fights
// a stylesheet. The numbers that are not fixed values — everything the card and the
// feature derive from the module's constants (cqw sizes, shares of the frame, the focus
// gradient, the dissolve mask) — arrive as custom properties on `style` and LAND through
// `-(--…)` utilities: `w-(--ag-quote-column)`, `text-(length:--ag-quote-size)`. The
// property is the seam between the arithmetic and the CSS; the class says which
// property each number drives. There is no quote.css.
