// A three-state theme control: light, dark, and FOLLOW THE SYSTEM. Most toggles
// collapse that to a boolean, which quietly throws away the only setting a reader
// actually chose, and stops tracking when they change it at the OS.
//
// It is deliberately provider-agnostic: it takes the value and a setter, so it works
// with next-themes, with a hand-rolled context, or with nothing at all. Depending on
// a provider would make the item unusable to anyone who already has one.
